Why Fund SAFORA

Transparency & Trust

Every donation and transaction is automatically recorded and visible.

No room for mismanagement — donors and admins see exactly where money flows.

Automation of Fund Allocation

Contributions (like the ₹50 per tourist entry) go directly into the SAFORA trust account.

Funds are distributed into role-based UPI-linked accounts without manual delays.

Scalability & Versatility

Can be implemented for NGOs, trusts, tourism boards, and community projects.

Framework supports local, national, and global scale without changing the core system.

Social Impact at Scale

Strengthens accountability in social donations.

Builds confidence in contributors and increases long-term funding for community welfare.

Tech-Driven Solution

Uses automation + digital payments + smart tracking (can extend to blockchain for auditability).

Future-proof model that keeps up with evolving financial regulations.

Donor Engagement

Donors see measurable impact → increases repeat contributions.

Builds a culture of transparency in charitable giving and public trust systems.

Competitive Edge

No other system currently offers automatic allocation + transparency + role-based access in one package.

SAFORA becomes a pioneer in “Digital Trust Infrastructure.”
